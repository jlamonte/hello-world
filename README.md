Making changes to incorporate the purpose and goals of this exercise.
My goal is to become competent at coding. I have no aspiration of becoming a software engineer, but I would like to establish a sufficient foundation to be "dangerous". Part of this is a response to the fact that most executives at big companies are clueless about technology. I think that needs to change. I also am genuninely curious about how all of this works.
